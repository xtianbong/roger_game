# roger_game


Enriching game for my cat to play in exchange for treats.

The player is rewarded with treats (dispensed by a rotating servo) when they get 5 correct answers in a row.

## Requirements

Requires a raspberry pi system, a screen, wires and 3 binary input devices of your choice.

I used these pet communication buttons: [https://a.co/d/i0OjBEy](https://a.co/d/i0OjBEy)

You can solder two wires on either side of the internal switch such that you get a signal when the button is pressed. Make sure to run the return signal through a 10,000 Î© resistor.
